 - use definecommand for lua
 - redis config
 - organize routes
 - tests
 - docker compose

 - token in db?
 - more realistic routes?
 
testtask:

- Set a rate limit by token to 200 req/hour
- Set a rate limit by ip to 100 req/hour 

- Those numbers (token limit and ip limit) should be - configurable from the environment

- Bonus: keep performance in mind.
- Optional task: Create a different weight of a request for every URL: 1/2/5 points per request (you can assume we have 3 different end points) depending on end point.
